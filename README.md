## What it does 
When encountering a page not found while browsing the web, 404PageRevival provides a button to redirect to the according page in the Wayback Machine (internet archive)

## Limitations
404PageRevival detects a 'not found' page through status codes. However, this may not always be reliable as a site may serve a resource with the wrong status code or use an intermediary page to redirect back to the main page. Hence, the infobar may pop up even when the website is available.

## Install
Can be installed as a Tampermonkey script [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/484103-404pagerevival)
